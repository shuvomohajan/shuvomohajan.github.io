            Iâ€™m a web developer & designer. I love technology and I always enjoy
            learning new tech to improve my skill and build something awesome.{" "}
            <br /> <br /> I have been working as a backend Laravel developer for
            4 years now and I have also used many side tools to build awesome
            user interfaces and interactivity. I always Intend to work in a
            challenging and competitive environment where a strong sense of
            responsibility and commitment is required, where the place of the
            work provides potential avenues for learning, growing, and achieving
            a top position in the hierarchy of the organization.
